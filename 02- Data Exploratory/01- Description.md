in this phase:

- Review existing files, including file format, data type, and whether they are partitioned or not.
- Find the most efficient and cost-effective way to fetch the data.
- Input files are usually in CSV format.


## determine appropriate compute and storage solutions by:
o	Identify total number of records in source data to 
o	Identify record counts per day, week, or month to project data growth.
## Check data quality for:
o	Duplicates (remove them)
o	Missing values
o	Invalid information 
 	approach supplier of data to fix issue\
 	look for different data source\
 	manual transformations
## Join datasets from multiple sources, ensuring appropriate keys exist.
## Ensure data provides business value by:
o	having the right data items (columns)
o	performing necessary transformations
o	aggregations
o	additional requirement


##Practical Steps: 
- Check for duplicates in key columns.
- Identify missing data values.
- Look for unexpected values in columns.
- Ensure sufficient information is available to join datasets.
- Write SQL to get summary information for business decisions.
- Perform transformations as needed.
